# IDS706_Data_Engineering
Data Engineering (Fall'25)

The project required basic understanding of how to create github repository, connect it with VScode, create various files and run it correctly. 

The hello.py, test_hello.py and requirements file should always be there in your repository. 

There are a couple of steps to be followed, first being the creation of a github account. 
You create a new repository, keep readme file and gitignore and then export it to your local VScode by linking your account and install all dependencies and devcontainer. Once the environment is steady, create the files in your repository, add your code to yor working file- hello.py, add test cases in the test_hello.py and also write what requirements are needed in the requiremnets file. 

Run Makefile commands as needed: make install, make test, make format, make lint, make clean.
- Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
- Enable GitHub Actions for automation/Continuous Integration.
